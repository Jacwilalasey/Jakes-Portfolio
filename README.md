# Jakes-Portfolio


## Description 

A portfolio outlining who I am, what I can help you with and some of my most recent projects. Throughout this challenge I used a combination of HTML & CSS, focusing on utilising some of my newly learnt skills such as CSS variables, new selector variations and media queries.

## Challenge

 - When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar,   and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you.
 - When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
 - When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications.
 - When presented with the your first application then that applicationâ€™s image should be larger in size than the others.
 - When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.
 - When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.

## What I learned

I was able to practice with my new media query knowledge and toy around with different CSS variations in different sizes, also learning that it would be much easier to design mobile first rather than scaling down. 

I was also able to practice setting up root variables, such as colours to be used throughout my CSS.

## Installation

No installation required, it is a simple html/css site.
